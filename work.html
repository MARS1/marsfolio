    <h4>Compiled Works:</h4>
    <p>There is something inherently wrong with saying this is "my work". After all I've learned so many things from so many sources (too many to remember) and I prefer to think of these as the result of selective pooling from a collection of ideas others have discovered long before me and that I just happened to repurpose them for the particular project I was working on.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm never fully satisfied with my work or quick to pat myself on the back, which goes back to being infinitely curious. I want to always get better and I can only do that if put to more challenging tasks that will ultimately bring the best out of me, after several failed attempts ofcourse.</p>
